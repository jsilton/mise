# Mise (The Kitchen Standard)

The version-controlled culinary standard for the Master Kitchen.

## Overview

**Mise** is a high-performance, static recipe codex built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It represents a curated collection of family heritage and technical "Kitchen Standard" recipes, professionalized, validated, and discoverable.

### What is Mise?

A searchable, filterable recipe repository with 550+ family recipes organized by:

- **Cuisine** (Italian, Thai, Chinese, American, Mediterranean, etc.)
- **Difficulty** (Easy, Intermediate, Advanced)
- **Cooking Methods** (Bake, Roast, Fry, Steam, Slow-Cook, etc.)
- **Dietary** (Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, etc.)
- **Occasions** (Weeknight, Entertaining, Holiday, Comfort-Food, etc.)
- **Flavor Profile** (Spicy, Sweet, Savory, Acidic, Umami, Fresh, etc.)

## The Kitchen Standard

Every recipe adheres to the Kitchen Standard:

- **Versatility:** Common bases (sauces, stocks, rubs) are separated for reuse.
- **Textural Balance:** Technical methods like "Bone-Dry Standard" or "Staged Roasting" ensure perfect mouthfeel.
- **Modern Interpretation:** Traditional family recipes updated with culinary science while honoring their roots.
- **The Finishing Touch:** Every dish is balanced with acid, salt, or aromatic to bridge flavor profiles.
