## Chef's Note

Bibimbap is the ultimate "Fridge Clearing" meal, but the secret to a restaurant-quality bowl is the **texture contrast**. Each vegetable (Banchan) should be seasoned individually so their unique flavors shine through once mixed. If you want the authentic "Dolsot" crispy rice without a stone bowl, heat a **Cast Iron Skillet** with a layer of sesame oil, press the cooked rice into it for 5 minutes until it crackles, then assemble on top. The acid in the sauce is key—it brightens the heavy fat of the egg and sesame.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate Meat:** Mix the ground meat with soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and garlic. Let sit for 15 minutes.
2.  **The Sauce:** Whisk all "Soul Sauce" ingredients in a small bowl. Adjust vinegar for brightness.
3.  **The Banchan (Prep Vegetables):**
    - **Spinach & Sprouts:** Blanch in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and squeeze bone-dry. Toss with 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp minced garlic, and a pinch of salt.
    - **Carrots & Mushrooms:** Sauté in a wok or skillet over high heat with a splash of oil and salt for 2-3 minutes until just tender but still having "bite."
4.  **Cook Protein:** Sear the meat in a smoking hot wok until browned and slightly crispy.
5.  **The Eggs:** Fry eggs sunny-side up (runny yolk is essential for the "sauce" effect when mixed).
6.  **The Crispy Rice Hack (Optional):** Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high. Add 1 tbsp sesame oil. Spread the cooked rice in a flat layer and press down. Cook for 5 minutes without stirring until the bottom is golden and crunchy.
7.  **Assemble:** Place rice in the center of a bowl. Arrange vegetables and meat in distinct piles around the edge. Place the egg in the center. Top with seaweed strips and a generous dollop of the sauce.
8.  **The Rule:** You MUST mix it all together before eating. The yolk and sauce should emulsify into a creamy, spicy coating for every grain of rice.
