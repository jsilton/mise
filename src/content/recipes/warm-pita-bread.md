## Chef's Note

Good pita should be warm and pliable, with a slight char from the heat. The method matters: direct flame gives the best char and puff, but a hot dry skillet works perfectly. Brush with olive oil and a sprinkle of flaky salt for an elevated version. This takes 2 minutes but transforms the entire meal.

## Directions

1. **Dry Heat Method:** Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat until very hot.
2. **The Toast:** Place pita directly on the hot surface. Cook for 30 seconds per side until warm, pliable, and lightly charred.
3. **Optional Finish:** Brush warm pita with olive oil and sprinkle with flaky salt.
4. **Keep Warm:** Stack and wrap in a clean kitchen towel to keep warm until serving.

### Alternative Methods

- **Direct Flame:** Hold pita with tongs over a gas burner flame, flipping every few seconds until puffed and lightly charred.
- **Oven:** Wrap stack of pita in foil and warm at 350°F for 10 minutes.
- **Grill:** Place directly on grill grates over medium heat for 30 seconds per side.
