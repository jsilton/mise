## Chef's Note

Good coleslaw is about texture contrast—crisp cabbage against creamy dressing—and the balance of sweet, tangy, and savory. The secret is salting the cabbage first to draw out excess moisture, then dressing it no more than 30 minutes before serving. Dress too early and you get soggy slaw; too late and the flavors don't meld. The celery seed is non-negotiable—it's what makes this taste like the real deal.

## Directions

1. **The Prep:** Place sliced cabbage and grated carrots in a large colander. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt, toss, and let drain for 10 minutes. Squeeze out excess moisture with clean hands.

2. **The Dressing:** In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, sugar, Dijon mustard, and celery seed until smooth.

3. **The Toss:** Add drained cabbage and carrots to the dressing. Toss thoroughly to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **The Rest:** Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes (up to 30) to let flavors meld. Toss again before serving.
