## Chef's Note

The secret to crispy baked wings without frying is baking powder. Mixed into the dry rub, it raises the skin's pH, which breaks down proteins and draws moisture to the surface where it evaporates in the oven's heat. The result: shatteringly crisp skin with almost no effort. Rest the seasoned wings uncovered in the fridge for at least an hour (overnight is better) to dry the surface further. The lemon pepper butter goes on hot wings right out of the oven—the residual heat melts the butter into every crevice while the zest's oils bloom.

## Directions

1. **The Dry:** Pat wings completely dry with paper towels. In a large bowl, whisk together baking powder, salt, and pepper. Toss wings in the mixture until evenly coated.

2. **The Rest:** Arrange wings in a single layer on a wire rack set over a sheet pan. Refrigerate uncovered for 1-8 hours (minimum 1 hour, overnight is ideal).

3. **The Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Roast wings for 25 minutes, then flip each wing and roast another 20 minutes until golden and crispy.

4. **The Butter:** While wings roast, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in lemon zest, lemon juice, black pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Let steep.

5. **The Toss:** Transfer hot wings to a large bowl. Pour warm lemon pepper butter over wings and toss until evenly coated.

6. **Serve:** Transfer to a platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges on the side.
