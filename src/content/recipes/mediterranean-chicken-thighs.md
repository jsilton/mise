## Chef's Note

Greek dressing is a marinade cheat code—it's already perfectly balanced with oil, acid, garlic, and oregano. Marinating chicken thighs for even 30 minutes infuses Mediterranean flavor throughout. The peppers and onions roast alongside and get sweet and slightly charred. Serve it mezze-style: warm pita, cool tzatziki, salty feta, and crisp fresh vegetables. Everyone builds their own plate. The tzatziki from the lamb burgers recipe works perfectly here.

## Directions

1. **Marinate:** Toss chicken thighs with Greek dressing, oregano, and salt in a bowl or zip-lock bag. Marinate 30 minutes at room temperature (or up to 8 hours refrigerated).

2. **Prep Vegetables:** Toss bell peppers and onion wedges with olive oil and salt.

3. **Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Spread vegetables on a sheet pan. Nestle marinated chicken thighs among the vegetables. Roast 30-35 minutes until chicken is cooked through (165°F) and vegetables are tender and charred at edges.

4. **Make Tzatziki:** While chicken roasts, prepare the yogurt-cucumber sauce from the [[greek-style-lamb-burgers-with-yogurt-cucumber-sauce]] recipe (or use store-bought tzatziki).

5. **Warm Pita:** Wrap pitas in foil and warm in oven during last 5 minutes of cooking.

6. **Prep Fresh Vegetables:** Arrange lettuce, sliced cucumber, halved tomatoes, and crumbled feta on a platter.

7. **Serve:** Slice chicken and serve family-style with roasted peppers and onions, warm pita, tzatziki, and fresh vegetables. Everyone builds their own plate.

## Variations

- **Chicken Shawarma Style:** Add 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the marinade
- **Lemon-Heavy:** Add zest and juice of 1 lemon to the marinade
- **Bone-In Thighs:** Increase cook time to 40-45 minutes for crispier skin
