## Chef's Note

Queso fundido is Mexico's answer to fondue—molten cheese with smoky chorizo, meant to be scooped with warm tortillas. The key is using Oaxaca cheese, which melts into long, stretchy strands without breaking. Roasting the poblanos first adds a layer of charred sweetness that elevates this beyond typical bar queso. Serve it straight from the oven in the cast iron—it stays molten for about 10 minutes before it starts to set. Make a half-batch without chorizo for vegetarians.

## Directions

1. **The Char:** Roast poblanos directly over a gas flame or under the broiler, turning until blackened all over (about 8 minutes). Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap for 5 minutes. Peel off skins, remove seeds, and dice.

2. **The Render:** Preheat oven to 400°F. In a 10-inch cast iron skillet, cook chorizo over medium-high heat, breaking into small pieces, until crispy and fat has rendered (5-6 minutes). Transfer chorizo to a plate, leaving fat in pan.

3. **The Soften:** Add onion and garlic to the chorizo fat. Sauté until softened (3 minutes). Add diced poblanos and stir to combine.

4. **The Melt:** Remove skillet from heat. Scatter both cheeses evenly over the vegetables. Top with the crispy chorizo.

5. **The Bubble:** Bake for **8-10 minutes** until cheese is completely melted and bubbling at the edges.

6. **The Finish:** Remove from oven. Top with fresh cilantro and pickled jalapeños if using.

7. **Serve:** Serve immediately with warm flour tortillas for scooping. Eat fast—this sets as it cools.

## Vegetarian Variation

Skip the chorizo. Sauté the onion and garlic in 1 tbsp olive oil. Add 1 tsp smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp cumin for smoky depth.
