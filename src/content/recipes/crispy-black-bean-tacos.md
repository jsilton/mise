## Chef's Note

These are not sad vegetarian tacos. Smashing canned black beans and roasting them until the edges crisp transforms their texture completely—you get creamy centers with crunchy, charred edges that rival any meat filling. The avocado crema adds richness and acid in one swoop. This is the vegetarian option that meat-eaters reach for.

## Directions

1. **The Crisp:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Spread drained beans on a sheet pan. Using a fork or potato masher, lightly smash about half the beans (leaving some whole for texture). Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with cumin, paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Toss to coat.

2. **The Roast:** Roast for **20-25 minutes**, stirring halfway through, until edges are dark and crispy. Squeeze lime juice over immediately.

3. **The Crema:** While beans roast, blend avocado, sour cream, lime juice, cilantro, garlic, and salt in a blender until smooth. Add water to reach drizzling consistency.

4. **The Char:** Heat a dry skillet or open flame. Char tortillas 20-30 seconds per side until pliable with dark spots.

5. **The Build:** Layer each tortilla with crispy beans, shredded cabbage, a generous drizzle of crema, cotija, pickled jalapeños, and fresh cilantro.

6. **Serve:** Serve immediately with extra lime wedges.
