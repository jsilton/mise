## Chef's Note

Chili oil is the secret weapon of Chinese cooking—a few spoonfuls transform dumplings, noodles, or rice into something extraordinary. The technique is simple: bloom aromatics in oil, then pour the hot oil over pepper flakes to release their color and flavor without burning. The oil temperature is critical—too hot and you'll burn the flakes (bitter), too cool and you won't extract the color (pale). Aim for 275-300°F.

## Directions

1. **The Prep:** Place red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, minced garlic, ginger, salt, and sugar in a heatproof bowl. This is your flavor base.

2. **The Infuse:** In a small saucepan, combine oil, star anise, cinnamon stick, and Sichuan peppercorns if using. Heat over medium until the oil reaches 275-300°F and the spices are fragrant, about 8-10 minutes.

3. **The Pour:** Remove whole spices with a slotted spoon. Carefully pour the hot oil over the pepper flake mixture—it will sizzle dramatically. Stir immediately.

4. **The Store:** Let cool completely, then transfer to a clean jar. Store at room temperature for up to 1 month. The sediment is the best part—stir before using.
