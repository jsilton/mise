## Chef's Note
The secret to a "Gold Standard" herbal cocktail is **Structural Science** through **The Aromatic Muddle Pattern**. You must muddle the basil *before* adding the liquid; this releases the chlorophyll and essential oils into the base of the glass, creating a botanical "Bounce" that defines the drink. The fresh grapefruit provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**, which we amplify with Angostura bitters to bridge the gap between the bitter tonic and the sweet juice.

## Directions

1.  **Muddle:** Place the chopped basil in the bottom of a tall Collins glass or highball glass. Use a muddler or the back of a spoon to press firmly for 10 seconds.
2.  **Thermal Prep:** Fill the glass to the brim with large ice cubes.
3.  **Combine:** Pour in the gin and the fresh grapefruit juice. Stir twice to integrate.
4.  **Effervescence:** Top with the tonic water or seltzer. Do not stir again—let the bubbles carry the basil essence to the top.
5.  **The High Note:** Add 3 dashes of bitters directly onto the surface.
6.  **The Slap:** Take the basil sprig, slap it between your palms to release the scent, and tuck it into the ice as a garnish.
