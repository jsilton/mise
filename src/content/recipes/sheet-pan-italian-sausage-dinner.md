## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate Tuesday night dinner: everything roasts on one pan, the broccoli steams while you wait, and store-bought rolls round it out. The key is getting the potatoes in the oven first—they need a head start to get crispy while the sausages just need to cook through and brown. Use good Italian sausage from the butcher counter (sweet for kids, hot for adults, or one of each). Halving the potatoes gives you more cut surface to crisp up. Piercing the sausages releases fat that bastes the potatoes.

## Directions

1. **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment.

2. **Season Potatoes:** Toss halved potatoes with olive oil, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Spread in a single layer on the sheet pan.

3. **Start Potatoes:** Roast potatoes alone for 15 minutes to get a head start on crisping.

4. **Add Sausage:** Remove pan, push potatoes to one side. Add sausage links, piercing each a few times with a fork. Return to oven.

5. **Roast Together:** Roast for 20 more minutes, flipping sausages halfway, until sausages are browned and cooked through (160°F internal) and potatoes are golden and crispy.

6. **Steam Broccoli:** While everything roasts, steam broccoli (about 5 minutes in a steamer basket or microwave).

7. **Serve:** Slice sausages on the bias. Serve with crispy potatoes, steamed broccoli, warm rolls, and mustard on the side.

## Notes

- **Sweet Italian Sausage:** Mild, fennel-forward, kid-friendly
- **Hot Italian Sausage:** Spicy kick, adult-preferred
- **Chicken Sausage:** Lighter option, same method
- For extra crispy potatoes, boil them first, smash with a fork, then roast at high heat
