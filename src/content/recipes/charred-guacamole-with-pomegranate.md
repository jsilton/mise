## Chef's Note

Broiling the jalapeños and tomatoes before adding them to guacamole transforms this familiar dip into something with smoky depth and caramelized sweetness. The charred vegetables add complexity that raw versions can't match. Pomegranate seeds aren't traditional, but they contribute jewel-like color, bursts of tart juice, and unexpected crunch that elevates this from snack to conversation piece.

## Directions

1. **The Char:** Position oven rack 6 inches from broiler. Place jalapeño and tomato halves cut-side down on a foil-lined sheet pan. Broil for **5-7 minutes** until skins are blistered and blackened in spots. Let cool slightly, then chop finely.

2. **The Mash:** Scoop avocado flesh into a large bowl. Add lime juice immediately and toss to coat (this prevents browning). Mash with a fork to desired consistency—slightly chunky is ideal.

3. **The Fold:** Add the chopped charred vegetables, red onion, garlic, cilantro, cumin, and salt. Fold gently until just combined.

4. **The Finish:** Transfer to serving bowl. Scatter pomegranate seeds over top.

5. **Serve:** Serve immediately with quality tortilla chips. If making ahead, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface and refrigerate up to 2 hours.
