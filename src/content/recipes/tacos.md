## Chef's Note

The secret to a great weeknight taco bar is **Contrast**. You have the soft tortilla, the savory meat, and the creamy avocado. Adding **Korean Pickled Cucumbers** provides a surprising and vital "acid-crunch" that elevates this from a standard box meal to something restaurant-worthy.

## Directions

1.  **Meat:** Brown the meat in a large skillet. Add 1/2 cup water and taco seasoning (or your own mix of chili powder, cumin, and garlic salt). Simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.
2.  **Shells:** Warm the hard shells in a 350°F oven for 5 minutes to crisp them. Warm tortillas in a dry pan.
3.  **Assemble:** Set everything out in bowls and let everyone build their own.
