## Chef's Note

This is the standard weeknight taco setup. Cooking the meat with "Better Than Bouillon" and water creates a rich sauce that coats the meat, preventing the dreaded dry taco filling. While traditional salsa is great, we like to mix cultures by adding Korean pickles for crunch.

## The Taco Bar Components

A proper taco night requires prepared sides. Use these recipes:

- **The Rice:** [Mexican Rice](/mise/recipes/spanish-rice-chorizo) (or use plain [Rice Pilaf](/mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf))
- **The Crunch:** [Korean Pickled Cucumbers](/mise/recipes/korean-pickled-cucumbers) (Oi Muchim) - highly recommended!
- **The Bean:** [Quick Seasoned Black Beans](/mise/recipes/quick-seasoned-black-beans)

## Directions

This Tex-Mex weeknight taco bar keeps lean ground turkey flavorful by simmering it with Better Than Bouillon chicken base, which adds umami depth that mimics slow-cooked meat. Korean pickled cucumbers provide a surprising tangy crunch that elevates the meal beyond standard taco seasoning.

## Directions

1.  **Meat:** Brown the meat in a large skillet. Add the 1/2 cup water, taco seasoning, and the 1 tsp of Better Than Bouillon. Simmer for 5 minutes until the liquid is reduced and the meat is saucy.
2.  **Shells:** Warm the hard shells in a 350°F oven for 5 minutes to crisp them. Warm tortillas in a dry pan.
3.  **Assemble:** Set everything out in bowls and let everyone build their own.
