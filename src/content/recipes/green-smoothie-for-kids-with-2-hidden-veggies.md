## Chef's Note
This is the ultimate high-performance "Fuel" for young palates. The secret to a kid-approved green smoothie is **Structural Science** through **The Thermal Blender Pattern**: by using frozen mango and fresh avocado together, we achieve a thick, creamy "Bounce" that masks the texture of the raw spinach. We use a **Double Hidden Veggie Pattern**: the avocado provides healthy fats and creaminess (Hidden Veggie #2), while the oats provide the complex carbohydrates needed for long-lasting energy. The vanilla extract is the mandatory **High Note** that creates the aroma of a milkshake.

## Directions

1.  **The Stack:** In a high-speed blender, add ingredients in this exact order: milk, oats, spinach, banana, avocado, and finally the frozen mango. Placing the greens at the bottom ensures they are completely pulverized first.
2.  **Process:** Blend on low, then quickly increase to high speed. Process for 60 seconds until the mixture is a vibrant, uniform green with no visible leaf flecks.
3.  **Adjust:** If the smoothie is too thick, add a splash more milk. If you need more "High Note" sweetness, add 1 tsp of maple syrup and pulse again.
4.  **Serve:** Serve immediately in a chilled glass with a wide straw.
