## Chef's Note

This Mediterranean dip transforms crumbly feta into a silky, whipped spread by emulsifying it with cream cheese and a generous pour of olive oil. The key is processing for a full 3-4 minutes until completely smooth—any graininess means you stopped too early. Greek feta (made with sheep's milk) whips creamier than French or Bulgarian varieties. Smoked paprika provides gentle warmth with a hint of smoke, while toasted pistachios add the crunch that takes this from "nice dip" to "where's the recipe?" territory. Make this ahead; it improves after a few hours in the fridge as the garlic mellows and flavors meld.

## Directions

1. **The Whip:** Combine feta, cream cheese, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a food processor. Blend for **3-4 minutes**, scraping down sides twice, until completely smooth and silky—no graininess should remain.

2. **The Spread:** Transfer to a shallow serving bowl or plate. Use the back of a spoon to create swirls and valleys that will catch the honey and oil.

3. **The Finish:** Drizzle generously with honey and olive oil. Dust with smoked paprika and a tiny pinch of cayenne. Scatter pistachios and fresh dill over top. Finish with flaky salt.

4. **Serve:** Serve at room temperature with warm pita triangles, cucumber spears, and bell pepper strips. The feta can be made up to 2 days ahead (add toppings just before serving).
