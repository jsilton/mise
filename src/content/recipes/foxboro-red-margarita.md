## Chef's Note

This playoff-worthy margarita balances reposado tequila's oak and vanilla against Campari's bitter complexity, bridged by a spiced cranberry syrup that adds tannic structure like a light red wine. The cranberry-Campari combination creates a deep crimson color and serious flavor that's far from a sugary party drink. Dissolving salt directly into the batch—rather than rimming glasses—chemically suppresses bitterness while adding savory depth. Each serving must be shaken hard to aerate properly since there's no salt rim to excite the palate.

## Directions

### Phase 1: The Prep (Night Before)

1. **The Syrup:** Combine cranberry juice, sugar, cinnamon sticks, and thyme in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat and simmer for **10 minutes**. Remove from heat and steep for **30 minutes**. Strain and refrigerate.

2. **The Ice:** Place 3 cranberries and 3 blueberries into each large ice cube mold. Fill with water and freeze overnight.

### Phase 2: The Batch (Before Kickoff)

3. **The Mix:** In a large pitcher, combine tequila, lime juice, cranberry syrup, Cointreau, and Campari. Add salt and stir vigorously until completely dissolved.

4. **The Taste:** Taste the batch—it should be intense. Adjust: too bitter, add 1 oz more syrup; too sweet, add 1 oz more lime; too sharp, add 1/2 tsp more salt.

5. **The Hold:** Keep pitcher refrigerated until serving. Do not add ice to the pitcher.

### Phase 3: The Serve (Game Time)

6. **The Shake:** Pour 4 oz of batch into a shaker tin. Fill with ice and shake hard for **10-12 seconds** until tin is frosted.

7. **The Build:** Place one Patriot Ice cube in a rocks glass. Strain cocktail over the cube.

8. **The Finish:** Express an orange peel over the glass—squeeze it shiny-side down to spray oils—rub it on the rim, and drop it in.
