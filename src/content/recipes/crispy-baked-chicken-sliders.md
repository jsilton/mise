## Chef's Note

The Chick-fil-A secret is pickle brine. Soaking chicken in pickle juice accomplishes two things: the salt brines the meat (keeping it juicy) while the vinegar's acid tenderizes it. The result is that distinctive tangy flavor in every bite. Baking on a wire rack lets air circulate underneath, crisping the bottom without flipping. A blast at 425°F with a light coat of cooking spray gives you that golden crunch without the deep fryer mess. These are the base for both BBQ and Sweet Chili variations—sauce them however you like.

## Directions

1. **The Brine:** Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally to make thin cutlets (about 1/2 inch thick). Place in a bowl or zip-lock bag with pickle juice. Refrigerate for 1-4 hours.

2. **The Dredge Station:** Set up three shallow dishes. First: flour mixed with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Second: beaten eggs. Third: panko breadcrumbs.

3. **The Bread:** Remove chicken from brine, pat dry. Dredge each cutlet in seasoned flour, then egg, then panko, pressing to adhere.

4. **The Bake:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Arrange breaded cutlets on a wire rack set over a sheet pan. Spray tops generously with cooking spray. Bake 18-20 minutes until golden and cooked through (165°F internal).

5. **The Slice:** Let rest 5 minutes. Cut each cutlet into slider-sized pieces (about 3x3 inches).

6. **Assemble:** Split Hawaiian rolls, add mayo, chicken piece, and pickles. Serve immediately.
