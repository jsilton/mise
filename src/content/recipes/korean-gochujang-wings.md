## Chef's Note

Korean fried chicken (KFC, the other one) is famous for its double-fry technique that creates impossibly crispy skin. We cheat with the baking powder method—same shatteringly crisp result, no deep fryer, no mess. The gochujang glaze is the star: fermented Korean chili paste brings fruity heat and deep umami, balanced by honey's sweetness and rice vinegar's bright acidity. Glaze the wings twice—once out of the oven to coat, then a quick broil to caramelize and lacquer them. The sesame oil goes in off-heat to preserve its nutty fragrance.

## Directions

1. **The Dry:** Pat wings completely dry with paper towels. In a large bowl, toss wings with baking powder and salt until evenly coated.

2. **The Rest:** Arrange wings in a single layer on a wire rack set over a sheet pan. Refrigerate uncovered for 1-8 hours (minimum 1 hour, overnight is ideal).

3. **The Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Roast wings for 25 minutes, flip, and roast another 20 minutes until golden and crispy.

4. **The Glaze:** While wings roast, whisk together gochujang, honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan. Simmer over medium heat for 3-4 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil.

5. **The First Coat:** Transfer hot wings to a large bowl. Pour half the glaze over wings and toss to coat evenly.

6. **The Broil:** Return glazed wings to the wire rack. Broil on high for 2-3 minutes, watching carefully, until the glaze caramelizes and becomes sticky.

7. **The Second Coat:** Toss wings with remaining glaze.

8. **Serve:** Transfer to a platter and top with green onions, sesame seeds, and gochugaru if you want more heat.
