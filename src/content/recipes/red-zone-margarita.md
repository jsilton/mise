## Chef's Note

This game-day margarita balances reposado tequila's oak and vanilla against Campari's bitter complexity, bridged by a spiced cranberry syrup that adds tannic structure like a light red wine. The combination creates a deep crimson color and serious flavor—far from a sugary party drink. Use reposado specifically; blanco lacks the oak notes to stand up to Campari, and añejo would be too heavy. Dissolving salt directly into the batch suppresses bitterness chemically while adding savory depth. Each serving must be shaken hard since there's no salt rim to excite the palate.

## Directions

### Phase 1: The Prep (Night Before)

1. **The Syrup:** Combine cranberry juice, sugar, cinnamon sticks, thyme, and cloves in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat and simmer for **10 minutes**. Remove from heat and steep for **30 minutes**. Strain through a fine mesh sieve and refrigerate. (Keeps 2 weeks.)

2. **The Ice:** Place 3 cranberries and 3 blueberries into each large ice cube mold. Fill with water and freeze overnight. These look spectacular and eliminate the need for garnishes.

### Phase 2: The Batch (Before Kickoff)

3. **The Mix:** In a large pitcher, combine tequila, lime juice, cranberry syrup, Cointreau, and Campari. Add salt and stir vigorously until completely dissolved—this is critical for balance.

4. **The Taste:** Taste the batch—it should be intense and slightly too strong (it will dilute when shaken). Adjust: too bitter, add 1 oz more syrup; too sweet, add 1 oz more lime; too sharp, add 1/2 tsp more salt. Trust your palate.

5. **The Hold:** Keep pitcher refrigerated until serving. Do not add ice to the pitcher—dilution happens during the shake.

### Phase 3: The Serve (Game Time)

6. **The Shake:** Pour 4 oz of batch into a shaker tin. Fill with ice and shake **hard** for 10-12 seconds until tin is frosted and painful to hold.

7. **The Build:** Place one Game Day Ice cube in a rocks glass. Strain cocktail over the cube.

8. **The Finish:** Hold an orange peel over the glass, shiny-side down. Squeeze to express oils (you'll see the mist). Rub the peel around the rim, then drop it in.
