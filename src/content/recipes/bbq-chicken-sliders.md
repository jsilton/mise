## Chef's Note

The difference between good and great sliders is building flavor at every step. Marinating the thighs in BBQ sauce with smoked paprika for even 30 minutes infuses flavor deep into the meat—don't skip this. Broiling chars the edges and caramelizes the sugars in the sauce. Sharp cheddar melted on top adds richness, pickles cut through with acid, and crispy fried onions bring texture. Brush the Hawaiian rolls with melted butter and toast them cut-side down in the oven while the chicken rests—this takes 2 minutes and makes a huge difference.

## Directions

1. **Marinate:** Toss chicken thighs with 1/3 cup BBQ sauce, olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Let sit 30 minutes at room temperature (or up to 4 hours refrigerated).

2. **Broil:** Position rack 6 inches from broiler. Remove chicken from marinade, shake off excess. Broil on a sheet pan for 6-7 minutes per side until charred and cooked through (165°F).

3. **Glaze & Cheese:** Brush hot chicken generously with remaining BBQ sauce. Top each thigh with cheddar. Broil 1-2 more minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.

4. **Toast Rolls:** While chicken rests, brush cut sides of Hawaiian rolls with melted butter. Place cut-side down on a sheet pan and toast under broiler for 1-2 minutes until golden.

5. **Slice:** Let chicken rest 5 minutes. Slice into slider-sized pieces.

6. **Assemble:** Add chicken with melted cheese to toasted rolls. Top with pickles and crispy fried onions. Serve with extra BBQ sauce.
