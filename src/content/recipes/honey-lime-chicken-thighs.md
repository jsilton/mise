## Chef's Note

This is the weeknight answer to carnitas—all the sticky, charred, taco-ready satisfaction in 35 minutes instead of 8 hours. The honey-soy-lime glaze caramelizes under the broiler, creating lacquered edges that crisp up beautifully. Boneless thighs are forgiving and stay juicy even if you overshoot the timing. Reserve half the glaze for brushing at the end—this double-glazing technique builds layers of flavor and ensures maximum stickiness.

## Directions

1. **The Glaze:** Preheat oven to 425°F. In a small bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, lime juice, cumin, paprika, garlic, and olive oil. Reserve half in a separate bowl for finishing.

2. **The Prep:** Pat chicken thighs dry. Season with salt and pepper. Toss with half the glaze mixture.

3. **The Roast:** Arrange chicken in a single layer on a sheet pan (use parchment for easy cleanup). Roast for **20 minutes**.

4. **The Char:** Brush chicken with reserved glaze. Switch oven to **BROIL**. Broil **3-4 minutes** until glaze is bubbling and chicken has charred, sticky edges. Internal temp should read 165°F.

5. **The Slice:** Let rest 5 minutes, then slice or chop for tacos.

6. **Serve:** Pile onto warm tortillas with rice, avocado, pickled onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime. Or serve as a bowl over rice with all the fixings.
