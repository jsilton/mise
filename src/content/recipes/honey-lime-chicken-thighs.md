## Chef's Note

This is the weeknight answer to carnitas—all the sticky, charred, taco-ready satisfaction in 35 minutes instead of 8 hours. The secret ingredient is fish sauce: one tablespoon disappears into the glaze but adds the savory depth that makes people ask "what's in this?" The honey-soy-lime glaze caramelizes beautifully under the broiler, creating lacquered edges while the thighs stay juicy. Pull them at 160°F and let carryover cooking finish the job during the rest—this five minutes is non-negotiable for juicy meat.

## Directions

1. **The Glaze:** Preheat oven to 425°F. In a small bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, fish sauce, lime juice, lime zest, cumin, paprika, garlic, and oil. **Reserve half** in a separate bowl for finishing—this double-glaze technique builds layers of flavor.

2. **The Prep:** Pat chicken thighs **completely dry** with paper towels (moisture is the enemy of browning). Season lightly with salt and pepper. Toss with half the glaze mixture.

3. **The Roast:** Arrange chicken in a single layer on a parchment-lined sheet pan—don't crowd or they'll steam. Roast for **18-20 minutes** until starting to brown.

4. **The Char:** Brush chicken generously with reserved glaze. Switch oven to **BROIL**. Broil **3-4 minutes**, watching carefully, until glaze is bubbling and chicken has charred, sticky edges. Pull at **160°F** internal temp.

5. **The Rest:** Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for **5 minutes**. Carryover cooking will bring temp to 165°F. Slice or chop for tacos.

6. **Serve:** Pile onto warm tortillas with rice, avocado, pickled onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime. Scatter sesame seeds over top if using. Or serve as a bowl over rice with all the fixings.
