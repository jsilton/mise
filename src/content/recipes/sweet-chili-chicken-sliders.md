## Chef's Note

This slider gets its depth from a quick soy-sesame-garlic marinade that seasons the chicken before it hits the broiler. The sweet chili glaze goes on at the end for that sticky, lacquered finish. Don't skip the sriracha mayo—it bridges the sweet glaze and savory chicken. The store-bought Asian salad kit (cabbage, crispy wontons, sesame dressing) is a legit shortcut that adds crunch, freshness, and another layer of sesame flavor. Toast those Hawaiian rolls—the butter helps them stand up to the juicy chicken.

## Directions

1. **Marinate:** Toss chicken thighs with soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Let sit 30 minutes at room temperature (or up to 4 hours refrigerated).

2. **Make Glaze:** Whisk together sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, and rice vinegar. Set aside.

3. **Make Sriracha Mayo:** Mix mayo and sriracha. Set aside.

4. **Broil:** Position rack 6 inches from broiler. Remove chicken from marinade, shake off excess. Broil on a sheet pan for 6-7 minutes per side until charred and cooked through (165°F).

5. **Glaze:** Brush hot chicken generously with sweet chili glaze. Broil 1-2 more minutes until sticky and caramelized.

6. **Toast Rolls:** While chicken rests, brush cut sides of Hawaiian rolls with melted butter. Toast cut-side down under broiler for 1-2 minutes until golden.

7. **Prep Slaw:** Toss the Asian salad kit with its dressing.

8. **Slice:** Let chicken rest 5 minutes. Slice into slider-sized pieces.

9. **Assemble:** Spread sriracha mayo on toasted rolls. Add glazed chicken, top with Asian slaw. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and cilantro if using.
