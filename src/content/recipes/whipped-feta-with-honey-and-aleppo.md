## Chef's Note

This Mediterranean dip transforms crumbly feta into a silky, whipped spread by blending it with cream cheese and olive oil. The key is processing for a full 3-4 minutes until completely smooth—any graininess means you stopped too early. Aleppo pepper provides gentle, fruity heat that won't overwhelm kids, while honey bridges the salty cheese and fresh dill. Make this ahead; it actually improves after a few hours in the fridge as the flavors meld.

## Directions

1. **The Whip:** Combine feta, cream cheese, olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice in a food processor. Blend for **3-4 minutes**, scraping down sides twice, until completely smooth and silky.

2. **The Spread:** Transfer to a shallow serving bowl or plate. Use the back of a spoon to create swirls and valleys.

3. **The Finish:** Drizzle generously with honey and olive oil. Scatter Aleppo pepper and fresh dill over top. Finish with a pinch of flaky salt.

4. **Serve:** Serve at room temperature with warm pita triangles, cucumber spears, and bell pepper strips.
