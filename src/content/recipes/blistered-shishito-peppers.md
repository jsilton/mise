## Chef's Note

Shishito peppers are the perfect last-minute appetizer—five minutes from bag to plate. The key is a screaming hot cast iron and the discipline not to move the peppers once they hit the pan. You want deep char and blisters on one side before flipping. Most shishitos are mild and sweet, but roughly one in ten packs surprising heat—this Russian roulette element makes them fun for groups. Eat them whole, stem and all (the stem is edible when charred).

## Directions

1. **The Heat:** Heat a cast iron skillet over **high heat** until smoking, about 3 minutes.

2. **The Blister:** Toss peppers with oil. Add to skillet in a single layer—work in batches if needed. **Do not move** for 2 minutes until charred and blistered on one side.

3. **The Flip:** Toss or flip peppers. Cook 1 minute more until blistered all over but still bright green.

4. **The Finish:** Transfer immediately to a serving plate. Squeeze lime over top and shower with flaky salt.

5. **Optional Upgrade:** Drizzle with soy sauce and sesame oil for a Japanese izakaya finish.

6. **Serve:** Eat immediately while hot. These don't hold.
