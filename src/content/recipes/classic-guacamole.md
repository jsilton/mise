## Chef's Note

Great guacamole is about texture and restraint. You want chunks, not baby food. The key technique: mash only half the avocado to create a creamy base that holds everything together, then fold in the rest in rough chunks for texture. Salt early and generously—avocado absorbs salt and needs more than you think. Lime juice isn't just for flavor; the acid slows oxidation (browning). The traditional molcajete (Mexican mortar and pestle) gives you control over texture, but a fork works fine. Skip the tomato if you want pure avocado flavor—it's optional in authentic Mexican versions. Serve within an hour; guacamole doesn't keep.

## Directions

1. **The Aromatics:** If using a molcajete, grind the salt, jalapeño, and a tablespoon of onion into a paste. Otherwise, finely mince the jalapeño and combine with diced onion.

2. **The Base:** Halve avocados, remove pits. Scoop flesh into a bowl. Add the jalapeño-onion mixture (or paste), lime juice, salt, and cumin.

3. **The Mash:** Using a fork, mash about half the avocado until relatively smooth. Fold in the remaining chunks, keeping them intact.

4. **The Finish:** Fold in remaining onion, cilantro, and tomato if using. Taste and adjust salt and lime.

5. **Serve:** Transfer to a serving bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface if not serving immediately (prevents browning). Serve with tortilla chips within 1 hour.

## Variations

- **Spicy:** Add a serrano pepper or leave jalapeño seeds in
- **Smoky:** Add 1 canned chipotle pepper, minced
- **Creamy:** Add 2 tbsp sour cream
- **Chunky:** Use 5 avocados and mash less
