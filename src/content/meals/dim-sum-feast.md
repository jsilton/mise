## Meal Overview

An ambitious dim sum spread featuring handmade dumplings in two styles—delicate har gow and savory shumai. This is a weekend project meal, best tackled with a partner or family to help with the wrapping. The reward is restaurant-quality dim sum at home.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Make dough and fillings** the day before or early morning
2. **Set up an assembly station** - dough, filling, water for sealing
3. **Wrap dumplings together** - make it a social activity
4. **Make cucumber salad** - needs 30+ minutes to marinate
5. **Prepare dipping sauce** - 5 minutes, can be done ahead
6. **Steam dumplings in batches** - 8-10 minutes per batch
7. **Serve hot** with sauce and condiments

## Notes

- Freeze extra dumplings on a sheet pan before bagging
- A bamboo steamer makes this more authentic but metal works
- Add store-bought char siu bao to round out the feast
