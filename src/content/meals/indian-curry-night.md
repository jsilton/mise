## Meal Overview

A rich, creamy vegetable korma that cooks itself in the slow cooker while you go about your day. Served with fluffy basmati rice and warm naan for scooping, this is vegetarian comfort food at its finest.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Morning: Start korma** - prep vegetables, add to slow cooker
2. **Let slow cooker do its thing** - 6-8 hours on low
3. **1 hour before dinner: Make naan dough** - needs time to rest
4. **45 min before: Start rice**
5. **30 min before: Roll and cook naan**
6. **Finish korma** - stir in cream/yogurt at the end
7. **Serve family-style** with rice, naan, and chutneys

## Notes

- Add cream at the end to prevent curdling
- Store-bought naan works if short on time
- Mango chutney on the side is a must
