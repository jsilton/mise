## Meal Overview

Classic Southern BBQ that's almost entirely hands-off thanks to the slow cooker. The pork shoulder transforms into tender, shreddable perfection while you go about your day. Paired with creamy coleslaw for crunch and contrast, plus warm cornbread to soak up the juices.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Start pulled pork in the morning** - needs 8-10 hours on low
2. **Make cornbread batter** 30 minutes before serving
3. **Prep coleslaw** while cornbread bakes - salt cabbage, make dressing
4. **Shred pork** and mix with your favorite BBQ sauce
5. **Bake cornbread** in a cast iron skillet for crispy edges
6. **Finish coleslaw** and let rest 15 minutes
7. **Serve buffet-style** - let people build their own plates

## Notes

- The pork shoulder can cook overnight if you prefer
- Toast the cornbread leftovers for breakfast
- Add pickles and sliced onions for a more authentic spread
