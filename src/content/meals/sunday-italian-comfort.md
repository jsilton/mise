## Meal Overview

The quintessential Sunday dinner—slow-cooked bolognese over fresh pasta with crusty garlic bread and a bright salad to cut through the richness. This is a project meal, perfect for a lazy afternoon when you want the house to smell amazing.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Start the bolognese early** - it benefits from long simmering (2+ hours ideal)
2. **Make pasta dough** while sauce simmers - it needs 30 min rest anyway
3. **Prepare salad components** - wash greens, make dressing, hold separately
4. **Roll and cut pasta** 30 minutes before serving
5. **Make garlic bread** while pasta water heats
6. **Boil fresh pasta** - only 2-3 minutes for fresh, time it right
7. **Dress salad** just before plating

## Notes

- The bolognese freezes beautifully—make a double batch
- If short on time, use dried pasta (but fresh is worth the effort)
- A good Chianti or Sangiovese pairs perfectly
