## Notes

- Marinate chicken in the morning for deeper flavor
- Ken's Greek Dressing works great, or use homemade vinaigrette
- For tzatziki: mix Greek yogurt, grated cucumber (squeeze out water), garlic, olive oil, lemon, and salt
- Store-bought tzatziki (Trader Joe's, Sabra) works in a pinch
- Add hummus for extra mezze vibes
