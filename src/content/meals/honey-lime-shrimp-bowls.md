## Meal Overview

When you need dinner fast, these shrimp bowls deliver. The garlic-honey-lime sauce is addictive—sweet, tangy, with just enough heat—and shrimp cook in minutes. The baking soda trick gives restaurant-quality texture. Start to table in 30 minutes.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Start rice immediately** - coconut jasmine rice takes 20 minutes
2. **Prep shrimp** - peel, devein if needed, toss with baking soda, rinse
3. **Steam bok choy** while rice finishes
4. **Cook shrimp** - 2 minutes per side, don't overcrowd
5. **Add glaze** - honey, lime, garlic coat the shrimp
6. **Build bowls** - rice, bok choy, shrimp, drizzle with extra sauce

## Notes

- Use large shrimp (16-20 count) for easier cooking
- The sauce also works great on chicken or tofu
- Add red pepper flakes for heat
