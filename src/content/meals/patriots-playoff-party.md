## Meal Overview

A quality game-day spread that's sophisticated enough for adults but approachable for kids. Everything works at room temperature for 2+ hours, there are vegetarian options at every station, and the whole thing preps in about an hour. The Foxboro Red Margarita—bitter-sweet with cranberry and Campari—sets the tone: this isn't a junk food party.

- Have a mocktail version of the margarita ready for non-drinkers
- Buy dessert from a good bakery—you're doing enough
