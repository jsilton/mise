## Meal Overview

Simple game day: broiled chicken sliders two ways (BBQ and Sweet Chili), creamy slow cooker mac and cheese, fresh guacamole, and chips with salsa. Friends are bringing chips + dip, salad, and veggie snacks. The sliders are dead simple—season, broil, glaze, done. Mac runs in the slow cooker hands-off. You're drinking margaritas by kickoff.

## Notes

- Chicken thighs are forgiving—they stay juicy even if slightly overcooked
- Keep some plain sliders for picky kids (no sauce)
- Mac stays creamy on WARM for hours
- Have kid drinks ready (juice boxes, lemonade)
- The Asian slaw is a bagged salad kit—zero prep, just toss with dressing
