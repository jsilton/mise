## Meal Overview

A quality game-day spread that's sophisticated enough for adults but approachable for kids. Everything works at room temperature for 2+ hours, there are vegetarian options at every station, and the whole thing preps in about an hour. The Red Zone Margarita—bitter-sweet with cranberry and Campari—sets the tone: this isn't a junk food party.

- [Whipped Feta with Honey](/recipes/whipped-feta-with-honey) — creamy, salty, sweet with toasted pistachios (V)

- [Queso Fundido with Chorizo](/recipes/queso-fundido-with-chorizo) — bubbling, shareable, irresistible

## Notes

- All apps except queso work at room temperature for 2+ hours
- Queso stays molten for about 10 minutes—plan accordingly
- Label vegetarian items clearly (marked V above)
- The black bean tacos are the vegetarian main—substantial enough for a meal
- Make half the queso without chorizo for vegetarians (see recipe)
- Have the mocktail version of the margarita ready for non-drinkers
- Buy dessert from a good bakery—you're doing enough
