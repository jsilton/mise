## Meal Overview

A soul-warming Chinese soup supper with homemade wontons floating in savory broth, accompanied by garlicky greens and a cool, crunchy cucumber salad for contrast. The wontons can be made ahead and frozen for even faster weeknight cooking.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Make cucumber salad first** - it benefits from 15+ minutes of marinating
2. **Prep wonton filling and wrap** - this is the main time investment
3. **Make broth** while wrapping wontons (or use premade)
4. **Prep bok choy** while broth simmers
5. **Cook wontons** in broth - 5-6 minutes
6. **Quick-sear bok choy** while wontons cook
7. **Serve immediately** - wontons get soggy if they sit

## Notes

- Make extra wontons and freeze on a sheet pan, then bag them
- Frozen wontons cook from frozen, add 2-3 minutes
- Add chili oil at the table for heat
