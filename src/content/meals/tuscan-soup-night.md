## Meal Overview

The famous Olive Garden soup, done better at home. Creamy, spicy, loaded with sausage and potatoes—this is pure comfort in a bowl. The crusty garlic bread is non-negotiable for soaking up every drop.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Brown sausage first** - builds flavor base
2. **Sauté aromatics** in sausage fat
3. **Add potatoes and broth** - simmer until tender
4. **Prep salad and garlic bread** while soup simmers
5. **Add kale and cream** in last 5 minutes
6. **Toast garlic bread** just before serving
7. **Serve soup immediately** with bread for dipping

## Notes

- Use hot Italian sausage if you like more kick
- The soup thickens as it sits - add broth when reheating
- Leftovers are even better the next day
