## Meal Overview

A full Thanksgiving spread scaled for a practice run or smaller gathering. Master these four components and you'll be ready for the big day. The turkey is the star, but the real heroes are the sides that make the plate complete.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Day before: Make cranberry sauce** - it sets overnight
2. **Morning: Prep stuffing** - cube bread, sauté aromatics
3. **4 hours before: Start turkey** - allow 15 min/lb plus resting
4. **2 hours before: Bake stuffing** - can go in with turkey
5. **1 hour before: Start potatoes** - boil, mash, keep warm
6. **Turkey out: Let rest 30 min** - this is crucial
7. **Make gravy** from drippings while turkey rests
8. **Carve and serve**

## Notes

- Dry-brining the turkey 24-48 hours ahead improves flavor dramatically
- Save turkey carcass for stock
- The stuffing also works baked inside the bird (add cook time)
