## Meal Overview

A bright, lemony pasta loaded with broccoli that's weeknight-fast but feels special. The pasta water emulsifies with lemon and parmesan to create a silky sauce without any cream. A satisfying vegetarian dinner that doesn't feel like you're missing anything.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Put pasta water on to boil** immediately
2. **Prep broccoli and lemon** while water heats
3. **Make salad** - wash greens, prep dressing, hold separate
4. **Cook pasta with broccoli** in the same pot
5. **Prep garlic bread** - can bake while pasta finishes
6. **Finish pasta** with lemon, cheese, pasta water
7. **Dress salad and serve**

## Notes

- Save a full cup of pasta water - you'll need it for the sauce
- Add grilled chicken to make it more substantial
- Use good parmesan - it's a key flavor
